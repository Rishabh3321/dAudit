# Welcome to dAudit

This is basically a **dApp** which manages audits inside university environment including different colleges , club heads 
and university itself.

# Theme
A lot of effort from universities and their staff goes into making students ready for their future as professionals. Times are changing and universities need to catch up! Put together a hack and solve some of the problems universities face or give a fresh approach to something outdated - this can be in management, entertainment, academics, research and even teaching.

# Idea 
 Generally we come across scams due to mismanagement of funds in the hierarchy of an University. We decided to build a hack for this problem to bring **trust** and **transparency** over authorities dealing with **funds**.
Since **Blockchain**  offers salient feature of **immutability** ,**transparency** ,so we preferred this stack to build our hack.

# hack
we basically build a hierarchy of College System,where we maintained the ledger/record of transactions between the university, college and different departments/clubs of college.
Inorder to make our hack more versatile and make transactions faster and efficient we integrated our dAudit dApp with scalable,efficient and instant blockchain transaction network.
